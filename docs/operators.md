etl4s uses a few simple operators to build pipelines:

| Operator | Name | Description | Example |
|----------|------|-------------|---------|
| `~>` | Connect | Chains operations in sequence | `e1 ~> t1 ~> l1` |
| `&` | Combine | Group sequential operations with same input | `t1 & t2` |
| `&>` | Parallel | Group concurrent operations with same input | `t1 &> t2` |
| `>>` | Sequence | Runs pipelines or nodes in order (ignoring previous output) | `p1 >> p2` |
